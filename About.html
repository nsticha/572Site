                    Hello reader, thank you for visiting my webpage! My name is Noah Sticha and I am currently a senior at UW-Madison. I study Geography and Cartography/GIS here, with an emphasis on environmental studies.

                    Why Geography? For as long as I can remember I have had a fascination with the world and spaces around me. I remember a 4 year old me putting my US states puzzle together day after day, and my desire to know what was outside the confines of my country only grew. Coming to UW-Madison, I had a passion for storytelling and getting to know the places and people around me. Initially I thought this would lead me to being a journalist. However, during my softmore year, I discovered the Geography and Cartography majors UW-Madison had to offer. Instantly I was hooked, as I could combine my desire to be a storyteller with my lifelong interest in the geograhical phenomena of our world. During my time in the Geography department, I discovered that Geography is so much more than just the political borders of Nations, its the study of spatial relationships between geographic features and their distribution, as well as the relationship between humans and the places they inhabit. Not only did the major expand my knowledge of the spatial relationships of people and places around me, but also improved my abilities as a mapmaker, becoming proficient in ArcGIS as well as Adobe illustrator. These skills have granted me an ability to see maps in a way I had never viewed them before, effective media that allow me to utilize my main passion, telling stories.

                    In my freetime, I love being outside. Anything from hiking, camping,  to relaxing on the beach, if its warm and sunny I'm here for it! I am also a major NFL sports buff. I love playing fantasy football and above all else watching my Minnesota Vikings. SKOL!!!
